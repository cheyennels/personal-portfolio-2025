        <h1 className="text-large">Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
        <p className="text-body">I'm a UX/UI-focused frontend developer who enjoys building products that are not only functional but also fun to use. In my work I've helped design and implement component-based design systems, streamlined development with tools like Storybook and React, and delivered polished interfaces across web and mobile.</p>
        
        <p className="text-body">I like working at the intersection of design and codeâ€”making sure that what gets built feels as good as it looks. Whether it's collaborating with designers, improving team consistency with design systems, or experimenting with new tools and patterns, I'm always looking for ways to make the process smoother and the end result more engaging.</p>
        
        <p className="text-body">I'm currently working on a personal app that blends cute aesthetics with motivation to get outside and be active. Sharing my progress helps me grow as both a designer and a developer, and I love connecting with others who are passionate about making tech more human and enjoyable.</p>
